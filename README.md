# Jenesis-Data-Store

Jenesis Data Store (JDS) is 90% complete. Expect a GitHub link soon. I've made a wrapper and tested it against T-SQL, Postgres and SQLite.
All my serialise and desrialize tests work against all platforms.
I wrote all of these tests in a single day. 
The library was able to save 10,000 records to an SSD in under 2 seconds against TSQL.
This library will help devs like me who suck at database design but want super fast object based prototyping with zero breaking changes.
Code will be uploaded soon
